## Installation

At [Mindsize](https://mindsize.me) we believe in composer driven projects and most of our plugins require an autoloader generated by [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/). Installation of our plugins may require an extra step to generate this autoloader. Packaged, user-installable releases will generally include the autoloader.

### Composer Powered WordPress

If your WordPress website is powered by composer and already is loading the vendor autoload file, just require the plugin by running the command below from your terminal.

`composer require mindsize/wp-plugin-base`

### From GitHub

After cloning this repository, run `composer install` in the root directory of the plugin. If you are using **git based deployments**, make sure the vendor directory is no longer ignored.

### From Packaged Releases on WordPress.org

Packaged releases on WordPress.org will automatically include the required autoloaders.
